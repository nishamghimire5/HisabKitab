# ðŸŽ‰ Fixed Issues & New Features Implementation

## âœ… **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Expense Persistence Issue**

**Problem:** Expenses were not being saved to Supabase database - they disappeared after page reload and weren't visible to other users.

**Solution:**

- âœ… Updated `AddExpenseModal` to call the new persistence function
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript types for Supabase insert operations
- âœ… Now expenses are saved permanently and shared across all users

### 2. **Email Display Instead of Names**

- âœ… Updated `ExpenseList` to show names in payer/participant lists
- âœ… Updated `SettlementSummary` and `MemberBalances` to use display names
