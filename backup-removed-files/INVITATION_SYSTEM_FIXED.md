# Invitation System - FIXED! 🎉

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ **Primary Issue: Invitations Not Appearing**

**Root Cause**: Row Level Security (RLS) on the `trips` table was preventing invited users from seeing trip details through the `trips!inner` join.

**Solution**: The RLS policies needed to be updated to allow users with pending invitations to view the trip details.

### ✅ **Secondary Issue: Trip Name Not Showing**

**Root Cause**: Incorrect object property access - Supabase joins nest data under the table name (`trips` not `trip`).

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Updated property access**: Changed `invitation.trip?.name` to `invitation.trips?.name`
2. **Enhanced invitation text**: Now shows "invited you to join [Trip Name]" instead of just "invited you to join"
3. **Updated TypeScript interface**: Added `trips?` property to match actual data structure
4. **Added debugging**: Console logs to help troubleshoot similar issues in future

## Current Status

**✅ Working Features:**

- Friend requests send and receive properly
- Trip invitations are created successfully
- Invitations appear in the invited user's notification bell
- Proper trip name display in invitations
- Correct inviter information (name, username, avatar)
- Accept/Decline functionality
- Expiration date handling

**✅ Enhanced Display:**

- Shows inviter's full name and username
- Shows actual trip name in invitation
- Clear expiration date
- Professional invitation card design

## Testing Results

**From the console logs, we can confirm:**

- ✅ 4 invitations found in database
- ✅ All invitations have correct status: "pending"
- ✅ All invitations have valid expiration dates
- ✅ User can access invitation data
- ✅ Invitations now display properly in UI
