# PRIVACY AND FRIENDS SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Invitation Display Issues âœ…

**Problem**: Invitations showed "Someone" instead of proper usernames/emails
**Solution**: Enhanced `InvitationNotifications.tsx` to properly load inviter details:

- Added proper joins to get trip and inviter information
- Implemented fallback loading for inviter profiles
- Shows username, full name, and email appropriately

### 2. Enhanced Privacy in User Search âœ…

**Problem**: User search was too revealing and showed suggestions with partial input
**Solution**: Updated `UserSearch.tsx` with privacy-focused approach:

- **Minimum Requirements**: Complete email (with @ and .) OR 4+ character username
- **Exact Match**: Only shows exact matches instead of partial matches
- **No Suggestions**: Doesn't show any results until complete input is provided
- **Updated Placeholder**: "Enter complete email or username (min 4 chars)..."

### 3. Created Friends System ðŸ†•

**New Feature**: `FriendsManager.tsx` component with full friends functionality:

- **Add Friends**: Search and send friend requests
- **Manage Requests**: Accept/decline incoming friend requests
- **Friends List**: View and manage existing friends
- **Selection Mode**: Easy friend selection for trip invitations
- **Privacy Focused**: Uses same privacy-enhanced search

### 4. Database Schema for Friends ðŸ“‹

**New Tables**: `create-friends-system.sql`

- `user_friends` table with proper relationships
- RLS policies for secure access
- Indexes for performance
- Status tracking (pending/accepted/declined)
