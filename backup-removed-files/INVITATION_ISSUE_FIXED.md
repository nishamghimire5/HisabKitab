# INVITATION ISSUE RESOLVED ✅

## Root Cause Identified

The issue was that **invitations were being created without an `expires_at` field**, but the loading query was filtering for `expires_at > NOW()`. This meant:

1. ✅ Invitations were successfully created and stored
2. ❌ Loading query filtered them out due to missing expiration date
3. ❌ Users never saw their invitations

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Expiration Dates to New Invitations**

**In TripMemberManagement.tsx:**

```typescript
const expirationDate = new Date();
expirationDate.setDate(expirationDate.getDate() + 7); // 7 days from now

const invitations = profiles.map((profile) => ({
  // ...other fields
  expires_at: expirationDate.toISOString(),
}));
```

**In Index.tsx (trip creation):**

- Same fix applied for friend invitations during trip creation

### 2. **Fixed Loading Query to Handle Missing Expiration Dates**

**In InvitationNotifications.tsx:**

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
.gt('expires_at', new Date().toISOString())

// After (FIXED):
.or(`expires_at.gt.${new Date().toISOString()},expires_at.is.null`)
```

This now loads invitations that either:

- Have an expiration date in the future, OR
- Have no expiration date set (null)

## Test the Fix

### For Existing Invitations:

The invitation you created (`36ce708f-0ee2-401c-b3a8-4d03088d4921`) should now be visible because the loading query handles null expires_at fields.

### For New Invitations:

All new invitations will include a 7-day expiration date and will be properly loaded.

## Verification Steps

1. **Sign in as the invited user** (`ng21041720@student.ku.edu.np`)
2. **Click the bell icon** (Trip Invitations)
3. **Check if the invitation appears**
4. **Click "Debug" button** to see detailed logs
5. **Try creating a new invitation** to test the complete flow

## Expected Results

✅ **Existing invitations** should now be visible  
✅ **New invitations** will have proper expiration dates  
✅ **Loading query** handles both cases correctly  
✅ **Complete invitation flow** should work end-to-end

The invitation system should now work perfectly! 🎉
