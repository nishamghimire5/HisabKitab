## ðŸ”§ Required: Apply Database Migration

To enable the collaborative features, you need to run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:

### Steps:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wlwazqzxmxmltpfpgvlg)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250617050000-add-usernames-and-invitations.sql`

### What the migration adds:

- **Username support** for user discovery
- **trip_members table** for better member management
- **trip_invitations table** for pending invitations
- **RLS policies** for security
- **Helper functions** for accepting invitations

3. **Create a trip and invite users**
4. **Test invitation flow** (send/receive/accept)
5. **Verify shared trips appear** in the dashboard
6. **Test collaborative expense tracking**
