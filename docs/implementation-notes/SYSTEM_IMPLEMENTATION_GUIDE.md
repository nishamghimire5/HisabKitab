# SettleUp Smart - Implementation Guide

This document provides an overview of the key systems implemented in SettleUp Smart and links to detailed documentation for each component.

## Core Systems

### 1. Invitation System

The invitation system allows trip creators to invite other users to join their trips. Invitations are sent via email and require acceptance before the user is added to the trip.

Key implementations:

- Trip invitations database table with proper RLS policies
- Accept invitation function with proper security checks
- UI components for sending and managing invitations

For detailed debugging and implementation notes, see the original [INVITATION_SYSTEM_FIXED.md](../../INVITATION_SYSTEM_FIXED.md) document.

### 2. Friends System

The friends system allows users to add each other as friends, making it easier to create trips together and share expenses.

Key implementations:

- User friends database table with proper RLS policies
- Friend request and acceptance flow
- UI components for managing friends

For detailed debugging and implementation notes, see the original [FRIENDS_SYSTEM_FIXES.md](../../FRIENDS_SYSTEM_FIXES.md) document.

### 3. Trip Member Management

Secure management of trip members with proper permissions and privacy controls.

Key implementations:

- Trip members database table with proper RLS policies
- UI components for adding and removing trip members
- Integration with invitation system

### 4. Database Schema

The complete database schema is available in [SCHEMA_BACKUP.sql](../sql-backups/SCHEMA_BACKUP.sql). This file contains all the tables, functions, and RLS policies implemented in the application.

## Security Considerations

- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables
- Security-definer functions are used for operations that require elevated privileges
- Proper input validation is implemented throughout the application

## Development Notes

- The application is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Supabase is used for authentication, database, and storage
- All API calls are properly typed using TypeScript interfaces
